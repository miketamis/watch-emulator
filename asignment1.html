    <h2>The Basic Idea</h2>

    <p>The idea is simple, a smart watch app that tracks how many sit ups you do daily and
    motivates you towards completing your set goal.</p>

    <h2>Similar apps</h2>I did some research on existing apps and found several apps for both
    Android and iOS, but none for any smart watch. The Android apps include:

    <h3>App 1: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rittr.situps">Sit
    Ups</a></h3>Very basic application.

    <h4>Initial Setup:</h4>When the user starts the application, it asks to select one of four
    goals: 100, 150, 200 and 250 sit ups in a row. Then it requires the user to do as many sit ups
    as they can in one set so it can determine the user’s start position. It also asks if the user
    is male or female.

    <h4>How goals are set:</h4>The goals are set manually by the user when they start the
    application for the first time. Once you have completed the goal, it puts you in strength
    training mode where it just repeats the same group of sets each day and no longer pushes you to
    improve yourself. It says that if you want you can reset the application and set a new goal but
    this means you lose your log :(

    <h4>Daily use:</h4>

    <p>Each day when you go to use the application it presents you with the day’s workout. This
    consist of about 4 sets of sit ups. Once started it takes you through each set stating the
    number of sit ups you have to do for each set. In between each set it has a cool-down timer
    before the next set starts.</p>

    <p>After completing all of the sets it asks how you how you found these sets so it can give you
    an appropriate number of reps next time. This is done by selected one of three options "It was
    too easy.", "It was just right." and "It was too hard."</p>

    <p>Then the user is presented with a progress screen where they can see how close they are to
    achieve their goal.</p>

    <h4>Achievement System:</h4>

    <p>Very basic, you can get three different trophy badges that you can post to your Facebook
    wall.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Bronze: when your 1/3 of the way to your goal.</li>

        <li>Silver: when your 2/3 of the way to your goal.</li>

        <li>Gold: when you have achieved your goal.</li>
    </ol>

    <p></p>

    <h4>Data:</h4>This app collects how many reps you do in each workout and lets you view it as
    list.

    <h3>App 2: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northpark.situps">Abs Sit
    Ups Workout</a></h3>Feature packed app. This app has lots of sounds. Has the ability to notify
    you daily/every x days to do your workout.

    <h4>Initial Setup:</h4>Just requires you todo as many sit ups as you can. Doesn't require you
    to set goals or specify your gender.

    <h4>How goals are set:</h4>

    <p>You start out at level 1 (or whatever level it puts you at based on your initial sit up
    count).<br>
    At the end of:<br>
    level 1: you should be able todo 100 straight sit ups.<br>
    Level 2: 150 straight sit ups.<br>
    Level 3: etc....</p>

    <p>Each level is broken down to 3 sub levels. Each sub level has a pre-set workout for you each
    day.</p>

    <h4>Daily use:</h4>

    <p>Very similar to App 1. “Sit Ups”. Alternates between telling you how many sit ups to do and
    then a cool down. It has a cool feature that while you are doing the sit ups you can tap the
    screen to cause the number to go down instead of counting the reps yourself.</p>

    <p>At the end of the work out it asks you the same three questions as App 1: "It was too
    easy.", "It was just right." and "It was too hard." Too easy cause you to go up a sublevel,
    just right keeps you on your current sublevel, too hard drops you down a sublevel.</p>

    <h4>Achievement System:</h4>Doesn't have one.

    <h4>Data:</h4>

    <p>Has the ability to sync with Google Fit. Although all it synchronises is calories burnt, it
    doesn't sync reps etc.</p>

    <p>Has ability to see the number of reps completed and Calories burnt on a graph.</p>

    <p>Allows you to back-up the data to SD card and Dropbox</p>

    <h3>App 3: <a href=
    "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runtastic.android.situp.lite">Runtastic
    Sit-Ups Trainer Plan</a></h3>One of Runtastics many apps and therefore integrates nicely with
    their ecosystem.

    <h4>Initial Setup:</h4>Requires your height and weight, but it can get this from your
    Runtatistic account if you have one. Doesn't require you to do any initial sit ups and
    therefore starts you off really easy, this is really annoying because it means that for a
    starter you don't get pushed or you have to skip forward a couple of weeks.

    <h4>How goals are set:</h4>

    <p>Levels System:<br>
    level 1: 20 sit ups in a row<br>
    level 2: 60 sit ups in a row<br>
    level 3: 100 sit ups in a row</p>

    <p>Each level is broken down in to 9 days where on the 9th day you only do one set where that
    one set is the level's goal. e.g. 20 sit ups in a row.</p>

    <h4>Daily use:</h4>

    <p>Same as the others, except for it use the accelerometer in your phone to automatically count
    down and on the last set of the workouts it lets you push yourself to see how many more sit ups
    you can do.</p>

    <h4>Achievement System:</h4>

    <p>Has badges that you can earn for doing various different things i.e. total number of sit
    ups. Each badge has multiple levels i.e. do 1,000 sit ups since you started then 2,000.</p>

    <p>It also has a leader board where it shows you against the rest of the world and your
    friends.</p>

    <h4>Data:</h4>

    <p>Nice statistics, total sit ups, average sit ups per day, calories burnt, etc. Has pretty
    graphs.</p>

    <p>Uploads all the data to your Runtastic account.</p>

    <h2>Emulator Plan</h2>

    <p>To keep things simple I'm going to have the emulator function very similar to <a href=
    "https://getpebble.com/pebble_time">Pebble Time.</a> This has two key advantages; one is
    that its functionality is very simple, and two I have one so it will help with visualizing real
    world application.</p>

    <p></p>

    <ul>
        <li>The screen will be 144px by 168px and wont be touch.</li>

        <li>No sound output</li>

        <li>It will be able to vibrate</li>

        <li>It will have four buttons, one on the left (Back Button) and three on the right(Top,
        Middle and Bottom Button)</li>

        <li>3-Axis Accelerometer</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img alt="Pebble Smarth Watch" src="pebble_watch.png"></p>

    <h2>App Plan</h2>

    <p>I'm going to use the workout schedule found on <a href=
    "twohundredsitups.com">twohundredsitups.com</a></p>

    <p>The following sketch shows the rough app flow:</p>

    <p>When you open the app for the very first time you are presented with the "Welcome" screen.
    Once the user hits the middle button they are taken to the "age" selection menu.</p>

    <p>The "age" selection screen gives you three options which correspond to the ages in <a href=
    "http://www.twohundredsitups.com/test.html">twohundredsitups.com initial test.</a> Clicking the
    top button sets the age to "under 30", clicking middle button sets the age to "30 to 39" and
    clicking bottom button set the age to "40 plus". It then take you to the "initial amount"
    test.</p>

    <p>The "initial amount" screen wants you to do as many sit ups as you can, and then enter the
    number, the top button increase the amount, the bottom button decrease the amount. The middle
    button sets the amount and takes you to the main "menu".</p>

    <p>The main menu is where you can find everything. T0 begin with all we need is “settings” and
    “start”. When you select “start” it will take you to the sit up screen. To get back to the main
    menu at any stage you can hold down the Back Button</p>

    <p>The "sit ups" screen will indicate how many sit ups you must perform, the progress bar at
    the top will show where you are at, dots indicate sit ups and arrows indicate rests. Once the
    user has finished all their sit ups they hit the middle button to move on, which takes them to
    the "rest" screen.</p>

    <p>The "rest" screen has how many seconds left you have to rest for. It will also have a pie
    chart in the background to give some visual feedback. If the user decides they don't want to
    rest the can skip the rest by clicking the middle button.</p>

    <p>Once you have completed all of your sets, you will be presented with the "done" screen,
    where you get three options, if you select "Too easy" you go up an exercise level, if you
    select "Just right" you stay on the current exercise, if you chose "Too hard" you go down an
    exercise level.</p><img alt="Scetch of my application" src="sketch.png" width="800">

    <h2>Future Plans</h2>Possible added functionality could include:

    <ul>
        <li>Using the accelerometer to count the sit ups</li>

        <li>Ability to set daily/x day alerts to work out</li>

        <li>Achievements</li>

        <li>Previous workouts</li>

        <li>graph of workouts</li>

        <li>ability to change some parameters in settings i.e. rest length</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Languages, Frameworks, IDE and Tools</h2>

    <h3>Version Control</h3>

    <p>I have decide to use git because it is easy to branch to try out a new approach or develop a
    new idea. On a large scale project I would prefer to use the <a href=
    "https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow">gitflow
    workflow</a>. As this is a relatively small project and I am the only developer I will use a
    more centralized workflow and can always easy to switch to gitflow if the project reaches a
    size where it would be of an advantage.</p>

    <p>I have decide to use Github to host my code as it is free, and I have been using it for a
    while and know my way around. I did look at some alternatives like https://bitbucket.org but
    didn't see any huge advantages over Github to make the switch.</p>

    <p>I will also use <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> and the command line
    to manage my git, I have used <a href="https://mac.github.com/">Github for Mac</a> before but
    prefer SourceTree, I looked into other git clients and found a nice comparison on <a href=
    "http://www.slant.co/topics/465/~what-are-the-best-git-clients-for-mac-os-x">slant</a> but on
    the basis of my experience and analysis have decided to use SourceTree.</p>

    <p>Github project.</p>

    <h3>HTML pre-processor</h3>

    <p>I decided not to use any html pre-processor because I have been using HTML for a while now
    and do not think it will be necessary. Also most IDEs including atom (the text editor I use)
    dosome clever autocomplete making it pretty easy to use.</p>

    <p>I did look at some HTML pre-processors:<a href="http://haml.info/">HAML</a> and <a href=
    "http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a>these did remove having to repeat the end tag which would be
    nice but would not be worth the trouble of having a pre-processor, and having to get used to
    writing in a new language. The other thing is that HAML and Jade used for templating which I
    would not be using in this client-side only application.</p>

    <p>I will be using "markdown" for my documentation and other notes as it is very easy to read
    and write in plain text and produces nice HTML.</p>

    <h3>CSS preproccesor</h3>

    <p>I have decide to use a CSS pre-processor because CSS on its own can become a monster. I have
    worked on project with CSS files over 3,000 lines, which became unmanageable.</p>

    <p>I found a list of the 6 main CSS pre-processors on <a href=
    "http://www.sitepoint.com/6-current-options-css-preprocessors/">sitepoint</a> this gave me a
    good overview but I still couldn't decide on which one to use. After after reading <a href=
    "http://www.zingdesign.com/less-vs-sass-its-time-to-switch-to-sass/">Less vs Sass? It's time to
    switch to Sass</a> I have decided to go with Sass, using SCSS as it is more familiar as it
    looks a lot like current CSS.</p>

    <h3>Build Tool</h3>

    <p>I needed a build tool, something that would take my nice development enviroment and bundle
    it up. There are 3 main tools I considered <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a> , <a href=
    "http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a>.</p>

    <p>I have used both Grunt and Gulp in webapp projects. I have used Make in other projects but
    not in a webapp project. In chosing between Grunt and Gulp I would go with Gulp, because it is
    uses streams which I really like to use, and have used in NodeJS projects. <a href=
    "https://medium.com/@preslavrachev/gulp-vs-grunt-why-one-why-the-other-f5d3b398edc4">Gulp vs
    Grunt. Why one? Why the Other?</a> Choosing between Make and Gulp was a lot harder. I read a
    lot of articles arguing the case for each of these. <a href=
    "https://algorithms.rdio.com/post/make/">Rdio Engineering Blog: The Ultimate Frontend Build
    Tool: make</a>, <a href=
    "http://gon.to/2015/02/26/gulp-is-awesome-but-do-we-really-need-it/">Gulp is awesome, but do we
    really need it?</a> , <a href="http://blog.depold.com/farewell-make-hello-gulp/">Farewell Make
    hello Gulp</a> , <a href=
    "http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/236xt4/a_case_for_makefiles_in_nodejs/">Reddit
    Comments on the matter</a> , <a href="http://shapeshed.com/making-the-case-for-make/">Making
    the case for make</a> and <a href=
    "http://www.100percentjs.com/just-like-grunt-gulp-browserify-now/">And just like that Grunt and
    RequireJS are out, it's all about Gulp and Browserify now</a></p>

    <p>The advantages of Gulp are that: you write the build script in javascript, there is a huge
    amount of documentation on how to get web development tools to work with it as this was what it
    was made to build,<a href="http://yeoman.io/learning/">Yeomans scaffolding use it,</a> and I
    would like to use Yeoman to get off the ground quicker, and Gulp is more cross platform (Make
    doesn't really work on windows)</p>

    <p>Advantages of Make, its proven as it has been used in thousands and thousands of projects,
    it would be good to get better at Make since its used everywhere, and it is potentially
    simpler.</p>

    <h3>Module Loader/Packers</h3>

    <p>I will want to use a module loader so I can separate my code into multiple files to keep my
    code cleaner.</p>

    <p>When looking at module loaders, you have to make a choice of which module format you want,
    AMD or CommonJS.</p>

    <p>AMD is what RequireJS uses and CommonJS is what nodeJS uses. I have used both nodeJS and
    RequireJS a lot in different projects, and I prefer CommonJS because you don't have to wrap
    your module in a define function, and you don't get confused by which variables equal which
    modules, and the code looks cleaner (less indents which I like).</p>

    <p>After reading a some comparisons and based on my past research <a href=
    "http://webpack.github.io/docs/comparison.html">webpacks comparsion</a> , <a href=
    "https://gist.github.com/substack/68f8d502be42d5cd4942">Browserify corrections to webpacks
    comparison</a> and <a href=
    "http://blog.namangoel.com/browserify-vs-webpack-js-drama">Browserify VS Webpack - JS
    Drama.</a> the choices appeared to be either Browserify and Webpack. I found<a href=
    "http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/">React Hot Loader</a>.which appeared to be
    awesome&nbsp; and would improve development speed a lot. React Hot Loader only works on
    Webpack. .</p>

    <p>However, I then found <a href=
    "https://github.com/milankinen/livereactload">LiveReactload</a> which is a Browserify version
    of React Hot Loader. This mean't that both bundlers were still on the table. In the end I
    decided to go with Browserify because it's easier to configure, and I always have the option to
    switch over to Webpack later if I need to.</p>

    <h3>MVC framework</h3>

    <p>There are a wide range of options for this but the main ones considered are:<a href=
    "https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> , <a href="https://muut.com/riotjs/">Riot</a> , <a href=
    "backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> , <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> ,
    <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a> , <a href="emberjs.com">Ember.js</a> , and
    <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a>.</p>

    <p>I found <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a> really useful as it let me see the same
    application in various different frameworks. I have used Angular before, and currently use
    Backbone.js at work. I found a good comparison<a href=
    "https://gist.github.com/makmanalp/9b7f50aa16d21c2f9d37">comparison</a>. I ended reading a
    whole lot of comparisons including <a href=
    "https://www.codementor.io/reactjs/tutorial/react-vs-angularjs#/">Code Mentor - React vs
    Angular</a>, <a href=
    "https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/angular-vs-react-the-tie-breaker">airpair - Angular
    vs. React</a> , <a href="http://joelburget.com/backbone-to-react/">Joel Burget - Backbone to
    React</a> and <a href=
    "http://www.code-experience.com/react-js-vs-traditional-mvc-backbone-ember-angular/">The Code
    Experience - React vs Traditional MVC</a></p>

    <p>I have decided to go with React as I like its speedy rendering and that you don't have to
    really worry about how you render elements because of the Virtual DOM. I also like the syntax
    and JSX. It is backed by Facebook and is used by other large companies so support isn't going
    to disappear overnight.</p>

    <h3>Testing Suit</h3>

    <p>Options include:<a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/">Jest</a> , <a href=
    "http://mochajs.org/">MochaJS</a>, <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> and <a href=
    "http://karma-runner.github.io/">Karma</a></p>

    <p>I have decided to go with Jest as it works well with React. also<a href=
    "http://andrew.codes/jest-vs-mocha-why-jest-wins/">Jest vs. Mocha: Why Jest Wins</a></p>

    <h3>Debug Tool</h3>

    <p>Options include:<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">Chrome Dev Tools</a> ,
    <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> , <a href=
    "https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/">Safari Development Tools</a> and <a href=
    "https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Tools">Firefox Developer Tools</a>.</p>

    <p>I have decided to go with Chrome Dev Tools, some links that shaped my choice <a href=

    What features does Firebug have that Chrome's Developer Tools do not have?</a></p>

    <h3>IDE/Text editor</h3>

    <p>There are heaps of IDE and I have tried out a lot of them <a href=
    "https://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> ,
    <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> and <a href=
    "https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a></p>

    <p>I have decided to go with <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> with <a href=
    "http://nuclide.io/">Nuclide</a> and other plugins installed. I have been using Atom for the
    last 6 months and have found it amazing, and now after finding and installing Nuclide the
    experience is even better</p>

    <p> I will also be using http://eslint.org/ with a plugin for Atom so I can see mistakes before
        I even try the application. </p>

    <p> Finally note I will be using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/"> Flux </a>
        as my application architecture </p>
